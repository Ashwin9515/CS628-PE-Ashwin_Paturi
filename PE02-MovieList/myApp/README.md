**PE02 â€“ Movie List**

**Input**  
The Movie List application displays a list of movies, with each movie described by a title, genre, and year of release. The list is filterable by selecting a genre from a dropdown menu with an "All" selection for displaying all movies. Clicking on a movie title creates an alert indicating the chosen title.

**Process**  
Movies are organized by title, genre, and release year. The application updates the displayed films based on the selected genre, and clicking a title opens a dialog box with the film's name. React's state and event-handling system manages this functionality for real-time updates.

**Output**  
After filtering by genre, users see films that match their selection, including title, genre, and release year. Selecting "All" shows the complete list. Clicking any title displays an alert with the movie's name, helping users confirm their selection.
