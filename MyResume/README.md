Input

It contains all the personal and professional details of the web application, such as the user's name, contact information, education, skills, work experience, projects, and certifications. In this case, the data is hardcoded in the Resume.js file; hence, it is predefined by the developer and is ready to be displayed.

Process

Once the application is running, React renders the information on the page. App.js is a central component; it imports Resume.js with all the details concerning its résumé. React will look at this file and create a view in the browser. The page is styled in Resume.css so that the margins, font sizes, and colors should be correctly set. Everything is categorized into sections: education, work experience, and skills, which one can easily read.

Output

A refined in-screen resume yields education and experience well-kept in structure and style. Further, it provides a clean output that is professional-looking and very easy to share or print, hence providing users with a very simple and efficient way of presenting their qualifications.
