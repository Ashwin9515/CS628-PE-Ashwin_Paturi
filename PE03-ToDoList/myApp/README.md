To-Do-List

Overview

Below is a simple To-Do List App created in React that allows users to add and remove tasks. The application has a very modern UI, having a blue background and red icons. It is smooth and interactive as far as user experience is concerned.

Input

The user types a task in the input field.
The user clicks the "➕ Add" button to add the task.
The user can delete a task by clicking the "❌" button next to it.

Process

State Management:
useState manages the list of tasks and the input field.

Adding a Task:
The input value is added to the list of tasks on clicking the "Add" button.

Removing a Task:
A click on the "Delete" button removes a task from the list.

UI Enhancements:
The app will feature hover effects, smooth transitions, and better spacing for modern look and feel.

Output

The list automatically updates, showing the new task added. When one removes a task, it disappears from the list. If no tasks exist, a message "No tasks yet. Add one! 😊" is shown.
